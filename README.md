# FilaDoge
FilaDoge (FLD) is the first open-source peer-to-peer digital meme-token on Filecoin Virtual Machine (FEVM). FEVM is a runtime environment for smart contracts (also called actors) on the Filecoin network, which brings user programmability to Filecoin, unleashing the enormous potential of an open data economy. Since the FEVM is fully EVM-compatible, new ERC-20 tokens can be launched on the Filecoin network or bridged directly to token pools on other chains. Users from the Ethereum can participate with their 0x addresses as well.

FilaDoge will be launching on March 14, 2023, the same day as the FEVM. To reward the promoters of the Filecoin FEVM and the outstanding contributors for both Filecoin and Ethereum ecosystem, FilaDoge will jump start with exciting games. The total supply of the FLD token is 1,000,000,000,000. 70% of the total supply will be allocated for the reward games during inception. 20% will be retained in a separate address for charity, donation and collaborations. 10% will be allocated for future games and activities. 

# Airdrop
Reward top 600 FIL holders* with 6% of the total supply!
Reward Vitalik & top 400 ETH holders (recorded from etherscan.io at Mar. 14 2023 - 2:00AM UTC) with 4% of the total supply!
* Due to limited knowledge of top FIL holders’ 0x or f4 addresses, this part of airdrop will be allocated to the Protocol Lab as a lump sum and to be re-distributed to FIL holders in the future.

# Mint
Early invitees will be able to mint their amount of FilaDoge token (FLD) from 20% of total supply by filling in their f4 address. An f4 address converter will be provided on the website to convert 0x addresses. The relationship between the FLD token amount and the order of claim is described by the following mathematical model, with the maximum of 500,000 addresses. The actual amount of FLD token received will be integer as the decimal points will be rounded down. 

$$
FLD{\kern 3pt}claim{\kern 3pt}amount = \frac{50,867,653,407}{claim{\kern 3pt}order + 10,000}
$$

|Order of Claims|	$FLD     |
|    :----:     |:--------:|
|1              |5,086,256 |
|100            |5,036,401 |
|1,000          |4,624,332 |
|10,000	        |2,543,382 |
|100,000        |462,433   |
|500,000        |99,740    |

# Lottery
Users may participant in a lottery game by filling in their f4 address and claim any random amount from 10,000 to 1,000,000 $FLD. The lottery game is concluded as soon as 20% of total supply is drained up.

# Inviter
Users can earn 400,000 FLD for each successful inviter by sharing the distinct inviter link to their crowd. A successful “Claim” or “Game” from a gambler will be considered as a successful inviter. Any address can only participate Mint, Lottery or both once. The first 500,000 inviters will be rewarded, which totaled 20% of FLD supply.
